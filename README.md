## Objective

**WP1**

WP1's objective is to develop a model for translating a Sign Language to Natural Language (Sign2Text).
The model should take **video input** and respond with a **translated text** (specifically, Thai (ไืทย)).

**WP5.1**

From the result of WP1, the model will be deployed for live inference as a part of a bi-directional Sign Language translation mobile application.
